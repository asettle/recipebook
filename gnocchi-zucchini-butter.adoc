=== Brown Butter Gnocchi with Zucchini

Been making this recipe since my university days - it's surprisingly
popular on the internet now. I sort of made it up back in the day - guess
I'm not that original after all.

I don't have a picture for this recipe, but take my word for it. The biggest
winner for this one is I've always had friend's kids LOVE the recipe, and
take it home with them.


Enjoy with a glass of wine, as modelled by me (again):

Ingredients::

* 500g of gnocchi (any brand will do, or you can make your own. See (https://aseasyasapplepie.com/how-to-make-gnocchi/[this recipe]).
* 2 tbsp butter (not margarine)
* 2 medium shallots, chopped (also known as spring onions, scallions, etc.)
* 2 large zucchinis (you can thinly slice, or just chop like I do)
* 200g of cherry tomatoes, halved
* 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 125g of Parmesan cheese
* 125g of fresh parsley
* salt and pepper

NOTE: If you would like to make this a recipe with meat, include 300g chicken breast
      chopped.

Method::

1. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Cook gnocchi until they float,
   3 to 5 minutes or according to package directions. Drain.
2. Melt butter in a pan on a medium-high heat until browning. (If you are cooking with chicken,
   add once the butter is melted)
3. Add shallots and zucchini and cook until softened.
4. Add tomatoes, salt, pepper, and nutmeg and continue cooking until the tomatoes
   are starting to break down.
5. Stir in Parmesan and parsley.
6. Add the gnocchi and coat. Serve immediately.
